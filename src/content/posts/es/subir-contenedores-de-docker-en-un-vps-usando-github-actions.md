We all love Docker, and if you don't, you should. 

Docker is a great tool that allows us to create containers with our applications and run them in any environment. But what if we want to deploy our containers in a VPS? Too complicated? Not at all! In this post, I will show you how to deploy your Docker containers in a VPS using Github Actions.

## What are we going to build?

We are going to build a simple workflow that will allow us to deploy our custom images to github container registry, pull them from our VPS and run them.

Esentially, this will be just like having a simple CI/CD pipeline.

- A VPS with Docker installed
- A Github repository with your app
